# graphql-crud

graphql-crud is a side project for me to learn Next.js, GraphQL and other cloud provider services. You can find it hosted [here](https://turbo-telegram.herokuapp.com/).

## Installation

Currently installation is not completely straight forward as there is no hasura migrations however that will be coming soon.

Development environment can be easily setup: 
1. Install all packages with `npm i`
2. Create `.env` and `hasura.env` files with the respective schemas from `.env.schema` and `hasura.env.schema`
3. Run `docker-compose up`
